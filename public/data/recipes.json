    "ingredients": "\n# Ingredients\n\n- 200g tempeh, cubed\n- 2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari\n- 1 tbsp maple syrup\n- 1 clove garlic, minced\n- 2 cups mixed vegetables (bell peppers, broccoli, snap peas work well)\n- 1 tbsp cooking oil\n- Optional garnishes:\n  - 1 tsp sriracha\n  - 1 tbsp sesame seeds\n  - 2 green onions, sliced\n    ",
    "instructions": "\n# Instructions\n\n1. **Prepare the sauce**: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, maple syrup, and minced garlic.\n\n2. **Cut and prepare**: Cube the tempeh into bite-sized pieces. Chop vegetables into similar-sized pieces for even cooking.\n\n3. **Heat the pan**: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.\n\n4. **Cook tempeh**: Add tempeh to the hot oil and cook for 3-4 minutes, tossing occasionally until lightly browned on multiple sides.\n\n5. **Add vegetables**: Add your chosen vegetables to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until beginning to soften but still crisp.\n\n6. **Add sauce**: Pour the sauce over the tempeh and vegetables, stirring quickly to coat. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.\n\n7. **Serve**: Transfer to bowls and top with optional garnishes if desired.\n\n> **Pro tip**: For extra flavor, marinate the tempeh in the sauce for 15 minutes before cooking if you have time.\n\n![Tempeh stir fry](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1618160702438-9b02ab6515c9?w=600&h=400&fit=crop)\n    ",
    "notes": "\n# Chef's Notes\n\nThis recipe is incredibly versatile:\n\n- **Protein swap**: No tempeh? Try using tofu, seitan, or chickpeas instead.\n- **Vegetable options**: Use whatever vegetables you have on hand - carrots, snow peas, mushrooms, and bok choy all work great.\n- **Sauce variations**: Add 1 tsp of grated ginger or a splash of rice vinegar to change up the flavor profile.\n- **Serving suggestions**: Serve with brown rice, quinoa, or rice noodles for a complete meal.\n\n*Remember, the #NoFuss philosophy is about working with what you have!*    \n    "
